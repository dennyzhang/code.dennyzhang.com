Reverse string
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Given a string and an integer k, you need to reverse the first k characters for every 2k characters counting from the start of the string. If there are less than k characters left, reverse all of them. If there are less than 2k but greater than or equal to k characters, then reverse the first k characters and left the other as original.
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
Example:
Input: s = "abcdefg", k = 2
Output: "bacdfeg"
#+END_EXAMPLE

Restrictions:
1. The string consists of lower English letters only.
- Length of the given string and k will in the range [1, 10000]

        while i < length:
            if i+k-1 < length:
                j = i+k-1
            else:
                j = length - 1
