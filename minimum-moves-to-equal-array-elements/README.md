Minimum Moves to Equal Array Elements  

---

Given a non-empty integer array of size n, find the minimum number of moves required to make all array elements equal, where a move is incrementing n - 1 elements by 1.  

    Example:
    
    Input:
    [1,2,3]
    
    Output:
    3
    
    Explanation:
    Only three moves are needed (remember each move increments two elements):
    
    [1,2,3]  =>  [2,3,3]  =>  [3,4,3]  =>  [4,4,4]
