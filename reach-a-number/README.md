You are standing at position 0 on an infinite number line. There is a goal at position target.  

On each move, you can either go left or right. During the n-th move (starting from 1), you take n steps.  

Return the minimum number of steps required to reach the destination.  

Example 1:  

    Input: target = 3
    Output: 2
    Explanation:
    On the first move we step from 0 to 1.
    On the second step we step from 1 to 3.

Example 2:  

    Input: target = 2
    Output: 3
    Explanation:
    On the first move we step from 0 to 1.
    On the second move we step  from 1 to -1.
    On the third move we step from -1 to 2.

Note:  
-   target will be a non-zero integer in the range [-10^9, 10^9].
