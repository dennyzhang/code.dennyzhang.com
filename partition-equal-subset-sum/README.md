Partition Equal Subset Sum  

---

Given a non-empty array containing only positive integers, find if the array can be partitioned into two subsets such that the sum of elements in both subsets is equal.  

Note:  
1.  Each of the array element will not exceed 100.
2.  The array size will not exceed 200.

    Example 1:
    
    Input: [1, 5, 11, 5]
    
    Output: true
    
    Explanation: The array can be partitioned as [1, 5, 5] and [11].

    Example 2:
    
    Input: [1, 2, 3, 5]
    
    Output: false
    
    Explanation: The array cannot be partitioned into equal sum subsets.
