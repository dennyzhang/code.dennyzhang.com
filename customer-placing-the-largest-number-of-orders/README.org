---------------------------------------------------------------------
Query the customer_number from the orders table for the customer who has placed the largest number of orders.

It is guaranteed that exactly one customer will have placed more orders than any other customer.

The orders table is defined as follows:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
| Column            | Type      |
|-------------------|-----------|
| order_number (PK) | int       |
| customer_number   | int       |
| order_date        | date      |
| required_date     | date      |
| shipped_date      | date      |
| status            | char(15)  |
| comment           | char(200) |
#+END_EXAMPLE

Sample Input
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
| order_number | customer_number | order_date | required_date | shipped_date | status | comment |
|--------------|-----------------|------------|---------------|--------------|--------|---------|
| 1            | 1               | 2017-04-09 | 2017-04-13    | 2017-04-12   | Closed |         |
| 2            | 2               | 2017-04-15 | 2017-04-20    | 2017-04-18   | Closed |         |
| 3            | 3               | 2017-04-16 | 2017-04-25    | 2017-04-20   | Closed |         |
| 4            | 3               | 2017-04-18 | 2017-04-28    | 2017-04-25   | Closed |         |
#+END_EXAMPLE

Sample Output
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
| customer_number |
|-----------------|
| 3               |
#+END_EXAMPLE

Explanation

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
The customer with number '3' has two orders, which is greater than either customer '1' or '2' because each of them  only has one order. 
So the result is customer_number '3'.
#+END_EXAMPLE

Follow up: What if more than one customer have the largest number of orders, can you find all the customer_number in this case?
