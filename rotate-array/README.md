# Leetcode: Rotate Array     :BLOG:Basic:


---

Right rotate array by k steps  

---

Rotate an array of n elements to the right by k steps.  

For example, with n = 7 and k = 3, the array [1,2,3,4,5,6,7] is rotated to [5,6,7,1,2,3,4].  

Note:  
Try to come up as many solutions as you can, there are at least 3 different ways to solve this problem.

Hint: Time O(n), Space O(1)  

Leave me comments, if you know how to solve.  

    ## Basic Ideas:
    ## Complexity: Time O(), Space O()
    ## Assumptions:
    ## Sample Data:
    class Solution(object):
        def findSubstring(self, s, words):
            """
            :type s: str
            :type words: List[str]
            :rtype: List[int]
            """
            ## barfoothefoobarman -> bar foo the foo bar man
    
    if __name__ == '__main__':
        s = Solution()
        # print s.findSubstring("barfoothefoobarman")
