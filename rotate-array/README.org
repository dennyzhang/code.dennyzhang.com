---------------------------------------------------------------------
Right rotate array by k steps
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Rotate an array of n elements to the right by k steps.

For example, with n = 7 and k = 3, the array [1,2,3,4,5,6,7] is rotated to [5,6,7,1,2,3,4].

Note:
Try to come up as many solutions as you can, there are at least 3 different ways to solve this problem.

Hint: Time O(n), Space O(1)

Leave me comments, if you know how to solve.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
class Solution(object):
    def findSubstring(self, s, words):
        """
        :type s: str
        :type words: List[str]
        :rtype: List[int]
        """
        ## Basic Idea:
        ## Complexity: Time O(), Space O()
        ## Assumptions:
        ## Sample Data:
        ## barfoothefoobarman -> bar foo the foo bar man

if __name__ == '__main__':
    s = Solution()
    # print s.findSubstring("barfoothefoobarman")
