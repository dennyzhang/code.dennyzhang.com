In a given integer array A, we must move every element of A to either list B or list C. (B and C initially start empty.)

Return true if and only if after such a move, it is possible that the average value of B is equal to the average value of C, and B and C are both non-empty.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
Example :
Input: 
[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]
Output: true
Explanation: We can split the array into [1,4,5,8] and [2,3,6,7], and both of them have the average of 4.5.
#+END_EXAMPLE

Note:

- The length of A will be in the range [1, 30].
- A[i] will be in the range of [0, 10000].Given an integer array of size n, find all elements that appear more than n/3 times. The algorithm should run in linear time and in O(1) space.
