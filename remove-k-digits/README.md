Given a non-negative integer num represented as a string, remove k digits from the number so that the new number is the smallest possible.  

Note:  
The length of num is less than 10002 and will be ≥ k.  
The given num does not contain any leading zero.  
Example 1:  

    Input: num = "1432219", k = 3
    Output: "1219"
    Explanation: Remove the three digits 4, 3, and 2 to form the new number 1219 which is the smallest.

Example 2:  

    Input: num = "10200", k = 1
    Output: "200"
    Explanation: Remove the leading 1 and the number is 200. Note that the output must not contain leading zeroes.

Example 3:  

    Input: num = "10", k = 2
    Output: "0"
    Explanation: Remove all the digits from the number and it is left with nothing which is 0.
