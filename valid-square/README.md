Given the coordinates of four points in 2D space, return whether the four points could construct a square.  

The coordinate (x,y) of a point is represented by an integer array with two integers.  

Example:  
Input: p1 = [0,0], p2 = [1,1], p3 = [1,0], p4 = [0,1]  
Output: True  

Note:  

1.  All the input integers are in the range [-10000, 10000].
2.  A valid square has four equal sides with positive length and four equal angles (90-degree angles).
3.  Input points have no order.
