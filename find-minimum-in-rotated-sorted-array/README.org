Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
(i.e., 0 1 2 4 5 6 7 might become 4 5 6 7 0 1 2).
#+END_EXAMPLE

Find the minimum element.

You may assume no duplicate exists in the array.

Leave me comments, if you know how to solve.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
## Basic Ideas: binary search
##      1 1 1 0 -1 -1 -1
## Complexity: Time O(log(n)), Space O(1)

# The guess API is already defined for you.
# @param num, your guess
# @return -1 if my number is lower, 1 if my number is higher, otherwise return 0
# def guess(num):

        """
        left, right = 1, n
        while left <= right:
            mid = left + (right-left)/2
            v = guess(mid)
            if v == 0:
                return mid
            elif v == 1:
                left = mid + 1
            else:
                right = mid - 1

        return None
