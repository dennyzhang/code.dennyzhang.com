---------------------------------------------------------------------
Given a matrix of size n x m, the elements in the matrix are 0,1,2.

0 for the sea, 1 for the island, and 2 for the city on the island(You can assume that 2 is built on 1, ie 2 also represents the island).
If two 1 are adjacent, then these two 1 belong to the same island. Find the number of islands with at least one city.

Notice
1. We only consider up, down, left and right as adjacent.
- n <= 100, m <= 100.
- You can assume that the four sides of the matrix are surrounded by the sea.

Example
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
Given mat =
[
     [1,1,0,0,0],
     [0,1,0,0,1],
     [0,0,0,1,1],
     [0,0,0,0,0],
     [0,0,0,0,1]
]
#+END_EXAMPLE
, return 0.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
Explanation:
There are 3 islands, but none of them contain cities.
