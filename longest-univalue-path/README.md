Longest Univalue Path  

---

Given a binary tree, find the length of the longest path where each node in the path has the same value. This path may or may not pass through the root.  

Note: The length of path between two nodes is represented by the number of edges between them.  

    Example 1:
    
    Input:
    
                  5
                 / \
                4   5
               / \   \
              1   1   5
    Output:
    
    2

    Example 2:
    
    Input:
    
                  1
                 / \
                4   5
               / \   \
              4   4   5
    Output:
    
    2

Note: The given binary tree has not more than 10000 nodes. The height of the tree is not more than 1000.
