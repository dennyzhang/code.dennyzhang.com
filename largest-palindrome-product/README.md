Largest Palindrome Product  

---

Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two n-digit numbers.  

Since the result could be very large, you should return the largest palindrome mod 1337.  

    Example:
    
    Input: 2
    
    Output: 987
    
    Explanation: 99 x 91 = 9009, 9009 % 1337 = 987

Note:  

The range of n is [1,8].
