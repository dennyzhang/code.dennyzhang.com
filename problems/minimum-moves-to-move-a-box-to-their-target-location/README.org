Storekeeper is a game in which the player pushes boxes around in a warehouse trying to get them to target locations.

The game is represented by a grid of size m x n, where each element is a wall, floor, or a box.

Your task is move the box 'B' to the target position 'T' under the following rules:

- Player is represented by character 'S' and can move up, down, left, right in the grid if it is a floor (empy cell).
- Floor is represented by character '.' that means free cell to walk.
- Wall is represented by character '#' that means obstacle  (impossible to walk there). 
- There is only one box 'B' and one target cell 'T' in the grid.
- The box can be moved to an adjacent free cell by standing next to the box and then moving in the direction of the box. This is a push.
- The player cannot walk through the box.

Return the minimum number of pushes to move the box to the target. If there is no way to reach the target, return -1.

Example 1:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
Input: grid = [["#","#","#","#","#","#"],
               ["#","T","#","#","#","#"],
               ["#",".",".","B",".","#"],
               ["#",".","#","#",".","#"],
               ["#",".",".",".","S","#"],
               ["#","#","#","#","#","#"]]
Output: 3
Explanation: We return only the number of times the box is pushed.

Example 2:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
Input: grid = [["#","#","#","#","#","#"],
               ["#","T","#","#","#","#"],
               ["#",".",".","B",".","#"],
               ["#","#","#","#",".","#"],
               ["#",".",".",".","S","#"],
               ["#","#","#","#","#","#"]]
Output: -1
#+END_EXAMPLE

Example 3:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
Input: grid = [["#","#","#","#","#","#"],
               ["#","T",".",".","#","#"],
               ["#",".","#","B",".","#"],
               ["#",".",".",".",".","#"],
               ["#",".",".",".","S","#"],
               ["#","#","#","#","#","#"]]
Output: 5
Explanation:  push the box down, left, left, up and up.

Example 4:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
Input: grid = [["#","#","#","#","#","#","#"],
               ["#","S","#",".","B","T","#"],
               ["#","#","#","#","#","#","#"]]
Output: -1
#+END_EXAMPLE
 
Constraints:

- m == grid.length
- n == grid[i].length
- 1 <= m <= 20
- 1 <= n <= 20
- grid contains only characters '.', '#',  'S' , 'T', or 'B'.
- There is only one character 'S', 'B' and 'T' in the grid.
