We are given some website visits: the user with name username[i] visited the website website[i] at time timestamp[i].

A 3-sequence is a list of websites of length 3 sorted in ascending order by the time of their visits.  (The websites in a 3-sequence are not necessarily distinct.)

Find the 3-sequence visited by the largest number of users. If there is more than one solution, return the lexicographically smallest such 3-sequence.

Example 1:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
Input: username = ["joe","joe","joe","james","james","james","james","mary","mary","mary"], timestamp = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10], website = ["home","about","career","home","cart","maps","home","home","about","career"]
Output: ["home","about","career"]
Explanation: 
The tuples in this example are:
["joe", 1, "home"]
["joe", 2, "about"]
["joe", 3, "career"]
["james", 4, "home"]
["james", 5, "cart"]
["james", 6, "maps"]
["james", 7, "home"]
["mary", 8, "home"]
["mary", 9, "about"]
["mary", 10, "career"]
The 3-sequence ("home", "about", "career") was visited at least once by 2 users.
The 3-sequence ("home", "cart", "maps") was visited at least once by 1 user.
The 3-sequence ("home", "cart", "home") was visited at least once by 1 user.
The 3-sequence ("home", "maps", "home") was visited at least once by 1 user.
The 3-sequence ("cart", "maps", "home") was visited at least once by 1 user.
#+END_EXAMPLE
 
Note:

1. 3 <= N = username.length = timestamp.length = website.length <= 50
- 1 <= username[i].length <= 10
- 0 <= timestamp[i] <= 10^9
- 1 <= website[i].length <= 10
- Both username[i] and website[i] contain only lowercase characters.
- It is guaranteed that there is at least one user who visited at least 3 websites.
- No user visits two websites at the same time.

- Solution:

#+BEGIN_SRC go
// https://code.dennyzhang.com/analyze-user-website-visit-pattern
// Basic Ideas: sort + hashmap
//
// Complexity: Time O(n^3), Space O(n)
import ("sort"
        "strings")
type MyNode struct {
    time int
    web string
}
func mostVisitedPattern(username []string, timestamp []int, website []string) []string {
    freqPath := ""
    max := 0
    m := map[string]int{}
    visits := map[string][]MyNode{}
    for i, user := range username {
        visits[user] = append(visits[user], MyNode{time:timestamp[i], web:website[i]})
    }
    for _, l := range visits {
        sort.Slice(l, func(i, j int) bool {
            return l[i].time<l[j].time
        })
        // get 3-sequence
        m2 := map[string]bool{}
        for i:=0; i<len(l); i++ {
            for j:=i+1; j<len(l); j++ {
                for k:=j+1; k<len(l); k++ {
                    path := l[i].web+"-"+l[j].web+"-"+l[k].web
                    m2[path] = true
                }
            }
        }
        for key, _ := range m2 {
            m[key]++
            if m[key] > max || (m[key] == max && key < freqPath) {
                max = m[key]
                freqPath = key
            }
        }
    }
    return strings.Split(freqPath, "-")
}
