You are given an integer array nums and you have to return a new counts array. The counts array has the property where counts[i] is the number of smaller elements to the right of nums[i].  

Example:  

    Given nums = [5, 2, 6, 1]
    
    To the right of 5 there are 2 smaller elements (2 and 1).
    To the right of 2 there is only 1 smaller element (1).
    To the right of 6 there is 1 smaller element (1).
    To the right of 1 there is 0 smaller element.
    Return the array [2, 1, 1, 0].
