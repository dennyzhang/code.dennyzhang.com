---------------------------------------------------------------------
In social network like Facebook or Twitter, people send friend requests and accept others' requests as well.
Table request_accepted holds the data of friend acceptance, while requester_id and accepter_id both are the id of a person.
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
| requester_id | accepter_id | accept_date|
|--------------|-------------|------------|
| 1            | 2           | 2016_06-03 |
| 1            | 3           | 2016-06-08 |
| 2            | 3           | 2016-06-08 |
| 3            | 4           | 2016-06-09 |
#+END_EXAMPLE

Write a query to find the the people who has most friends and the most friends number. For the sample data above, the result is:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
| id | num |
|----|-----|
| 3  | 3   |
#+END_EXAMPLE

Note:
- It is guaranteed there is only 1 people having the most friends.
- The friend request could only been accepted once, which mean there is no multiple records with the same requester_id and accepter_id value.

Explanation:
The person with id '3' is a friend of people '1', '2' and '4', so he has 3 friends in total, which is the most number than any others.

Follow-up:
In the real world, multiple people could have the same most number of friends, can you find all these people in this case?
