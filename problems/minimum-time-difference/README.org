Given a list of 24-hour clock time points in "Hour:Minutes" format, find the minimum minutes difference between any two time points in the list.
Example 1:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
Input: ["23:59","00:00"]
Output: 1
#+END_EXAMPLE

Note:
1. The number of time points in the given list is at least 2 and won't exceed 20000.
- The input time is legal and ranges from 00:00 to 23:59.

## Blog link: https://code.dennyzhang.com/minimum-time-difference
## Basic Ideas: Convert string to integer. 
##              Sort it. Then get difference with rotation enforced
##
## Complexity: Time O(1), Space O(1). There are only 60*24 possibilities.
