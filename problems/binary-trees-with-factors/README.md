Given an array of unique integers, each integer is strictly greater than 1.  

We make a binary tree using these integers and each number may be used for any number of times.  

Each non-leaf node's value should be equal to the product of the values of it's children.  

How many binary trees can we make?  Return the answer modulo 10 \*\* 9 + 7.  

Example 1:  

    Input: A = [2, 4]
    Output: 3
    Explanation: We can make these trees: [2], [4], [4, 2, 2]

Example 2:  

    Input: A = [2, 4, 5, 10]
    Output: 7
    Explanation: We can make these trees: [2], [4], [5], [10], [4, 2, 2], [10, 2, 5], [10, 5, 2].

Note:  

-   1 <= A.length <= 1000.
-   2 <= A[i] <= 10 ^ 9.
