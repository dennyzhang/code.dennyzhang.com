This is a follow up of [[https://code.dennyzhang.com/shortest-word-distance][Shortest Word Distance]]. The only difference is now you are given the list of words and your method will be called repeatedly many times with different parameters. How would you optimize it?

Design a class which receives a list of words in the constructor, and implements a method that takes two words word1 and word2 and return the shortest distance between these two words in the list.

For example,
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
Assume that words = ["practice", "makes", "perfect", "coding", "makes"].

Given word1 = "coding", word2 = "practice", return 3.
Given word1 = "makes", word2 = "coding", return 1.
#+END_EXAMPLE

Note:
You may assume that word1 does not equal to word2, and word1 and word2 are both in the list.

- Solution: hashmap
#+BEGIN_SRC go
// Blog link: https://code.dennyzhang.com/shortest-word-distance-ii
// Basic Ideas: hashmap
//   The problem is literally about: Find the mininum difference of two lists
//
// Complexity: Time O(n), Space O(n)
type WordDistance struct {
    index_map map[string][]int
}

func Constructor(words []string) WordDistance {
    m := map[string][]int{}
    for i, word := range words {
        m[word] = append(m[word], i)
    }
    return WordDistance{m}
}

func (this *WordDistance) Shortest(word1 string, word2 string) int {
    list1, list2 := this.index_map[word1], this.index_map[word2]
    res := 1<<31 - 1
    i, j := 0, 0
    for i<len(list1) && j<len(list2) {
