There is a new alien language which uses the latin alphabet. However, the order among letters are unknown to you. You receive a list of non-empty words from the dictionary, where words are sorted lexicographically by the rules of this new language. Derive the order of letters in this language.

Example 1:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
Given the following words in dictionary,

[
  "wrt",
  "wrf",
  "er",
  "ett",
  "rftt"
]
The correct order is: "wertf".
#+END_EXAMPLE

Example 2:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
Given the following words in dictionary,

[
  "z",
  "x"
]
The correct order is: "zx".
#+END_EXAMPLE

Example 3:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
Given the following words in dictionary,

[
  "z",
  "x",
  "z"
]
The order is invalid, so return "".
#+END_EXAMPLE

Note:
1. You may assume all letters are in lowercase.
- You may assume that if a is a prefix of b, then a must appear before b in the given dictionary.
- If the order is invalid, return an empty string.
- There may be multiple valid order of letters, return any one of them is fine.
