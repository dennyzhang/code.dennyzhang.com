Course Schedule
---------------------------------------------------------------------
There are a total of n courses you have to take, labeled from 0 to n - 1.

Some courses may have prerequisites, for example to take course 0 you have to first take course 1, which is expressed as a pair: [0,1]

Given the total number of courses and a list of prerequisite pairs, is it possible for you to finish all courses?

For example:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
2, [[1,0]]
#+END_EXAMPLE

There are a total of 2 courses to take. To take course 1 you should have finished course 0. So it is possible.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
2, [[1,0],[0,1]]
#+END_EXAMPLE

There are a total of 2 courses to take. To take course 1 you should have finished course 0, and to take course 0 you should also have finished course 1. So it is impossible.

Note:
1. The input prerequisites is a graph represented by a list of edges, not adjacency matrices. Read more about how a graph is represented.
- You may assume that there are no duplicate edges in the input prerequisites.

Hints:
1. This problem is equivalent to finding if a cycle exists in a directed graph.
- Topological Sort via DFS
- Topological sort could also be done via BFS.
