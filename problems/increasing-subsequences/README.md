Given an integer array, your task is to find all the different possible increasing subsequences of the given array, and the length of an increasing subsequence should be at least 2 .  

Example:  

    Input: [4, 6, 7, 7]
    Output: [[4, 6], [4, 7], [4, 6, 7], [4, 6, 7, 7], [6, 7], [6, 7, 7], [7,7], [4,7,7]]

Note:  

-   The length of the given array will not exceed 15.
-   The range of integer in the given array is [-100,100].
-   The given array may contain duplicates, and two equal integers should also be considered as a special case of increasing sequence.
