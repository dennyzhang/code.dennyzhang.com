Table point_2d holds the coordinates (x,y) of some unique points (more than two) in a plane.
Write a query to find the shortest distance between these points rounded to 2 decimals.
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
| x  | y  |
|----|----|
| -1 | -1 |
| 0  | 0  |
| -1 | -2 |
#+END_EXAMPLE

The shortest distance is 1.00 from point (-1,-1) to (-1,2). So the output should be:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
| shortest |
|----------|
| 1.00     |
#+END_EXAMPLE

Note: The longest distance among all the points are less than 10000.
