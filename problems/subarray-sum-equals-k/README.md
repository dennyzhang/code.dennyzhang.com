Given an array of integers and an integer k, you need to find the total number of continuous subarrays whose sum equals to k.  

Example 1:  

    Input:nums = [1,1,1], k = 2
    Output: 2

Note:  

1.  The length of the array is in range [1, 20,000].
2.  The range of numbers in the array is [-1000, 1000] and the range of the integer k is [-1e7, 1e7].
