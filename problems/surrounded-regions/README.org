Surrounded Regions
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Given a 2D board containing 'X' and 'O' (the letter O), capture all regions surrounded by 'X'.

A region is captured by flipping all 'O's into 'X's in that surrounded region.
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
For example,
X X X X
X O O X
X X O X
X O X X
After running your function, the board should be:

X X X X
X X X X
X X X X
X O X X

## Basic Ideas: Two kind of Os: 
##                 1 it will definitely not surrounded by 'X'. This happens when 'O' happens in the boarders.
##                 2 it might or might not
##
##              For case1, we mark it to 'Y'. Then go with DFS
##              After one pass, for positions of remaining O, they are all surrounded by 'X'
##                              for positions of all 'Y', they're fine
##
##             X    X    X    X    X
##             X    O    O    O    X
##             X    O    X    O    X
##             X    O    O    O    X
##             X    X    X    X    X
##             X    X    O    O    X
##             X    X    O    X    X
