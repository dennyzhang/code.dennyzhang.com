Write a bash script to calculate the frequency of each word in a text file words.txt.  

For simplicity sake, you may assume:  

-   words.txt contains only lowercase characters and space ' ' characters.
-   Each word must consist of lowercase characters only.
-   Words are separated by one or more whitespace characters.

For example, assume that **words.txt** has the following content:  

    the day is sunny the the
    the sunny is is

Your script should output the following, sorted by descending frequency:  

    the 4
    is 3
    sunny 2
    day 1

Note:  
Don't worry about handling ties, it is guaranteed that each word's frequency count is unique.
