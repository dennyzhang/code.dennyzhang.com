Given an array and a value, remove all instances of that value in-place and return the new length.
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Given an array and a value, remove all instances of that value in-place and return the new length.

Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.

The order of elements can be changed. It doesn't matter what you leave beyond the new length.

Example:

Given nums = [3,2,2,3], val = 3,

Your function should return length = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 2.

Leave me comments, if you know how to solve.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
## Basic Idea:
##        index point to the last element which have been processed
## Complexity: Time O(n), Space O(1)
class Solution(object):
    def removeElement(self, nums, val):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :type val: int
        :rtype: int
        """
        index = 0
        for n in nums:
            if n != val:
                nums[index] = n
                index += 1
        return index
