Several friends at a cinema ticket office would like to reserve consecutive available seats.
Can you help to query all the consecutive available seats order by the seat_id using the following cinema table?
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
| seat_id | free |
|---------|------|
| 1       | 1    |
| 2       | 0    |
| 3       | 1    |
| 4       | 1    |
| 5       | 1    |
#+END_EXAMPLE

Your query should return the following result for the sample case above.
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
| seat_id |
|---------|
| 3       |
| 4       |
| 5       |
#+END_EXAMPLE

Note:
- The seat_id is an auto increment int, and free is bool ('1' means free, and '0' means occupied.).
- Consecutive available seats are more than 2(inclusive) seats consecutively available.
