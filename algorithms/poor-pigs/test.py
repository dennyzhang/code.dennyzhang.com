## Description:
##     https://leetcode.com/problems/poor-pigs/description/
##    ,-----------
##    | There are 1000 buckets, one and only one of them contains poison, the rest are filled with water. They all look the same. If a pig drinks that poison it will die within 15 minutes. What is the minimum amount of pigs you need to figure out which bucket contains the poison within one hour.
##    | 
##    | Answer this question, and write an algorithm for the follow-up general case.
##    | 
##    | Follow-up:
##    | 
##    | If there are n buckets and a pig drinking poison will die within m minutes, how many pigs (x) you need to figure out the "poison" bucket within p minutes? There is exact one bucket with poison.
