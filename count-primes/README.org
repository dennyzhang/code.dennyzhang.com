## Basic Ideas: Sieve of Eratosthenes
##              If n is not a prime, it will have more than 1 dividends.
##              One of the dividend must less than sqrt(n)
##              1. Find primes from 2 to sqrt(n)
##              2. Mark the elements as not prime
##              3. The elements which are not visited are prime

## Complexity:
class Solution(object):
    def countPrimes(self, n):
        """
        :type n: int
        :rtype: int
        """
        if n <= 2:
            return 0
        l = [1] * n
        # l[i] indicate i
        i = 2
        while i*i < n:
            j = 2
            # mark non-prime
            while j*i<n:
                l[j*i] = 0
                j += 1
            # move to next prime
            i += 1
            while l[i] == 0 and i*i<n:
                i += 1
        return sum(l[2::])
