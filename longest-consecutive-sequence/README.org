Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.

For example,
Given [100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2],
The longest consecutive elements sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4]. Return its length: 4.

Your algorithm should run in O(n) complexity.

class Solution:
    # Compared to longestConsecutive_v1, no need to search in both directions.
    def longestConsecutive(self, nums):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        if len(nums) == 0: return 0
        s = set(nums)
        max_count = 0
        for num in set(nums):
            # only search from the biggest value of current group
            if num + 1 not in nums:
                y = num - 1
                while y in nums:
                    y = y -1
                max_count = max(max_count, num-y)
        return max_count

    ## Basic Ideas: one consecutive sequence will be one group
    ##       Build a hashmap
    ##       Then loop, combine group, and delete the absorted elements
    ##
    ##  Clarifications: Does the list contains duplicate elements? 
    ##           If yes, how you would like to treat the duplicate?
    ##
    ## Complexity: Time O(n), Space O(n)
