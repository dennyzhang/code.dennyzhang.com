Convert a Number to Hexadecimal  

---

Given an integer, write an algorithm to convert it to hexadecimal. For negative integer, two's complement method is used.  

Note:  

1.  All letters in hexadecimal (a-f) must be in lowercase.
2.  The hexadecimal string must not contain extra leading 0s. If the number is zero, it is represented by a single zero character '0'; otherwise, the first character in the hexadecimal string will not be the zero character.
3.  The given number is guaranteed to fit within the range of a 32-bit signed integer.
4.  You must not use any method provided by the library which converts/formats the number to hex directly.

    Example 1:
    
    Input:
    26
    
    Output:
    "1a"

    Example 2:
    
    Input:
    -1
    
    Output:
    "ffffffff"
