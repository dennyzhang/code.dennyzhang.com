Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Search Tree
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Given a binary search tree (BST), find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the BST.

According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: "The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes v and w as the lowest node in T that has both v and w as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself)."

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
        _______6______
       /              \
    ___2__          ___8__
   /      \        /      \
   0      _4       7       9
         /  \
         3   5
#+END_EXAMPLE

For example, the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of nodes 2 and 8 is 6. Another example is LCA of nodes 2 and 4 is 2, since a node can be a descendant of itself according to the LCA definition.

Leave me comments, if you know how to solve.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
## Basic Ideas: For BST, get min(p.val, q.val) and max(p.val, q.val)
##              Check from the root node
##              If both are smaller than root.val, move the left sub-tree
##              If both are bigger than root.val, move the right-tree
##              If one smaller and one bigger, the current node is what we want
## Assumption: No duplicate value in the BST
## Complexity: Time O(k), Space O(1). k is the height
