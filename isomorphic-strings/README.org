Isomorphic Strings
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Given two strings s and t, determine if they are isomorphic.

Two strings are isomorphic if the characters in s can be replaced to get t.

All occurrences of a character must be replaced with another character while preserving the order of characters. No two characters may map to the same character but a character may map to itself.
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
For example,
Given "egg", "add", return true.

Given "foo", "bar", return false.

Given "paper", "title", return true.
#+END_EXAMPLE

Note:
You may assume both s and t have the same length.

Leave me comments, if you know how to solve.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
## Basic Ideas:
##             Build 2 dicts
##             From s to t, and from t to s
##             For any new item to compare, make sure it won't viloate any dict
## Complexity: Time O(n), Space O(1). (Keys of dictionary is quite limited)
