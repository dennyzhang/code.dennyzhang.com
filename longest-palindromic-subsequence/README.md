Given a string s, find the longest palindromic subsequence's length in s. You may assume that the maximum length of s is 1000.  

Example 1:  

    Input:
    
    "bbbab"
    Output:
    4
    One possible longest palindromic subsequence is "bbbb".

Example 2:  

    Input:
    
    "cbbd"
    Output:
    2
    One possible longest palindromic subsequence is "bb".
