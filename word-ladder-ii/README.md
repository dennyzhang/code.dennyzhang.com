Word Ladder II  

---

Given two words (beginWord and endWord), and a dictionary's word list, find all shortest transformation sequence(s) from beginWord to endWord, such that:  

Only one letter can be changed at a time  
Each transformed word must exist in the word list. Note that beginWord is not a transformed word.  

    For example,
    
    Given:
    beginWord = "hit"
    endWord = "cog"
    wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log","cog"]
    Return
      [
        ["hit","hot","dot","dog","cog"],
        ["hit","hot","lot","log","cog"]
      ]

Note:  
-   Return an empty list if there is no such transformation sequence.
-   All words have the same length.
-   All words contain only lowercase alphabetic characters.
-   You may assume no duplicates in the word list.
-   You may assume beginWord and endWord are non-empty and are not the same.

UPDATE (2017/1/20):  
The wordList parameter had been changed to a list of strings (instead of a set of strings). Please reload the code definition to get the latest changes.
