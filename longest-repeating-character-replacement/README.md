Given a string that consists of only uppercase English letters, you can replace any letter in the string with another letter at most k times. Find the length of a longest substring containing all repeating letters you can get after performing the above operations.  

Note:  
-   Both the string's length and k will not exceed 10^4.

Example 1:  

    Input:
    s = "ABAB", k = 2
    
    Output:
    4
    
    Explanation:
    Replace the two 'A's with two 'B's or vice versa.

Example 2:  

    Input:
    s = "AABABBA", k = 1
    
    Output:
    4
    
    Explanation:
    Replace the one 'A' in the middle with 'B' and form "AABBBBA".
    The substring "BBBB" has the longest repeating letters, which is 4.
