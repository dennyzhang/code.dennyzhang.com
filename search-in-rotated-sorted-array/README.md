Search in Rotated Sorted Array  

---

Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.  

(i.e., 0 1 2 4 5 6 7 might become 4 5 6 7 0 1 2).  

You are given a target value to search. If found in the array return its index, otherwise return -1.  

You may assume no duplicate exists in the array.

    class Solution(object):
        def search(self, nums, target):
            """
            :type nums: List[int]
            :type target: int
            :rtype: int
            """
