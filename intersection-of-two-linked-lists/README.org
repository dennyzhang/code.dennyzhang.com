Intersection of Two Linked Lists
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Write a program to find the node at which the intersection of two singly linked lists begins.


For example, the following two linked lists:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
A:          a1 -> a2
                    \
                     c1 -> c2 -> c3
                   /            
B:     b1 -> b2 -> b3
begin to intersect at node c1.
#+END_EXAMPLE

Notes:

- If the two linked lists have no intersection at all, return null.
- The linked lists must retain their original structure after the function returns.
- You may assume there are no cycles anywhere in the entire linked structure.
- Your code should preferably run in O(n) time and use only O(1) memory.

Leave me comments, if you know how to solve.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
## Idea: get the count of two links
##       Skip the longer link with a proper offset.
##       Then compare two links node by node
## Complexity: Time O(n), Space O(1)
