Minimum Window Substring
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Given a string S and a string T, find the minimum window in S which will contain all the characters in T in complexity O(n).

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
For example,
S = "ADOBECODEBANC"
T = "ABC"
Minimum window is "BANC".
#+END_EXAMPLE

Note:
If there is no such window in S that covers all characters in T, return the empty string "".

If there are multiple such windows, you are guaranteed that there will always be only one unique minimum window in S.

Leave me comments, if you know how to solve.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
## Basic Ideas: Two pointers
##        Notice: T may have duplicate characters. AABC
##                T may be empty or only has one character
##              Let's say s[i:j] is the mininum window. Both s[i] and s[j] should be in T
##              Pointer: Check s from left to right. If s[k] in T, use pointer2 to find a candidate
##              Move pointer2 to find the next candiate

## Complexity: Time ? Space ?
