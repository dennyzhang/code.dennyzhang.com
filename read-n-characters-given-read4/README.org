The API: int read4(char *buf) reads 4 characters at a time from a file.

The return value is the actual number of characters read. For example, it returns 3 if there is only 3 characters left in the file.

By using the read4 API, implement the function int read(char *buf, int n) that reads n characters from the file.

Note:
The read function will only be called once for each test case.

## Basic Ideas: Use cached reading
##     Notice: We don't need to save the status of previous read function

## Complexity: Time O(n), Space O(1)
# The read4 API is already defined for you.
