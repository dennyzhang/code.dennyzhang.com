Guess Number Higher or Lower
---------------------------------------------------------------------
We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows:

I pick a number from 1 to n. You have to guess which number I picked.

Every time you guess wrong, I'll tell you whether the number I picked is higher or lower.

However, when you guess a particular number x, and you guess wrong, you pay $x. You win the game when you guess the number I picked.

Example:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
n = 10, I pick 8.

First round:  You guess 5, I tell you that it's higher. You pay $5.
Second round: You guess 7, I tell you that it's higher. You pay $7.
Third round:  You guess 9, I tell you that it's lower. You pay $9.

Game over. 8 is the number I picked.

You end up paying $5 + $7 + $9 = $21.
#+END_EXAMPLE

Given a particular n ≥ 1, find out how much money you need to have to guarantee a win.

Leave me comments, if you know how to solve.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
## Basic Ideas: binary search
##      1 1 1 0 -1 -1 -1
## Complexity: Time O(log(n)), Space O(1)

# The guess API is already defined for you.
# @param num, your guess
# @return -1 if my number is lower, 1 if my number is higher, otherwise return 0
