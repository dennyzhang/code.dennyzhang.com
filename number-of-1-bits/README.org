Number of 1 Bits
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Write a function that takes an unsigned integer and returns the number of '1' bits it has (also known as the Hamming weight).

For example, the 32-bit integer '11' has binary representation 00000000000000000000000000001011, so the function should return 3.

## Baisc Ideas: Each time n & (n-1) will remove one 1 bit
## Complexity: Time O(k), k is most many 1 bits it has. Space O(1)
