Table point holds the x coordinate of some points on x-axis in a plane, which are all integers.
Write a query to find the shortest distance between two points in these points.
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
| x   |
|-----|
| -1  |
| 0   |
| 2   |
#+END_EXAMPLE

The shortest distance is '1' obviously, which is from point '-1' to '0'. So the output is as below:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
| shortest|
|---------|
| 1       |
#+END_EXAMPLE

Note: Every point is unique, which means there is no duplicates in table point.

Follow-up: What if all these points have an id and are arranged from the left most to the right most of x axis?

select t1.x-t2.x as shortest
from point as t1 join point as t2
where t1.x>t2.x
order by (t1.x-t2.x) asc
limit 1
