There are a row of n houses, each house can be painted with one of the three colors: red, blue or green. The cost of painting each house with a certain color is different. You have to paint all the houses such that no two adjacent houses have the same color.  

The cost of painting each house with a certain color is represented by a n x 3 cost matrix.  

    For example, costs[0][0] is the cost of painting house 0 with color red; 
    costs[1][2] is the cost of painting house 1 with color green, and so on...
    Find the minimum cost to paint all houses.

Note:  
All costs are positive integers.
