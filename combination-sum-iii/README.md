Combination Sum III  

---

Find all possible combinations of k numbers that add up to a number n, given that only numbers from 1 to 9 can be used and each combination should be a unique set of numbers.  

    Example 1:
    
    Input: k = 3, n = 7
    
    Output:
    
    [[1,2,4]]

    Example 2:
    
    Input: k = 3, n = 9
    
    Output:
    
    [[1,2,6], [1,3,5], [2,3,4]]
