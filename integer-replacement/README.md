Given a positive integer n and you can do operations as follow:  

1.  If n is even, replace n with n/2.
2.  If n is odd, you can replace n with either n + 1 or n - 1.

What is the minimum number of replacements needed for n to become 1?  

Example 1:  

    Input:
    8
    
    Output:
    3
    
    Explanation:
    8 -> 4 -> 2 -> 1

    Example 2:
    
    Input:
    7
    
    Output:
    4
    
    Explanation:
    7 -> 8 -> 4 -> 2 -> 1
    or
    7 -> 6 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1
