Given a sorted array of integers nums and integer values a, b and c. Apply a quadratic function of the form f(x) = ax\*x + bx + c to each element x in the array.  

The returned array must be in sorted order.  

Expected time complexity: O(n)  

Example:  

    nums = [-4, -2, 2, 4], a = 1, b = 3, c = 5,
    
    Result: [3, 9, 15, 33]

    nums = [-4, -2, 2, 4], a = -1, b = 3, c = 5
    
    Result: [-23, -5, 1, 7]
