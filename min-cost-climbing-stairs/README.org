On a staircase, the i-th step has some non-negative cost cost[i] assigned (0 indexed).

Once you pay the cost, you can either climb one or two steps. You need to find minimum cost to reach the top of the floor, and you can either start from the step with index 0, or the step with index 1.
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
Example 1:
Input: cost = [10, 15, 20]
Output: 15
Explanation: Cheapest is start on cost[1], pay that cost and go to the top.
#+END_EXAMPLE

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
Example 2:
Input: cost = [1, 100, 1, 1, 1, 100, 1, 1, 100, 1]
Output: 6
Explanation: Cheapest is start on cost[0], and only step on 1s, skipping cost[3].
#+END_EXAMPLE

Note:
1. cost will have a length in the range [2, 1000].
- Every cost[i] will be an integer in the range [0, 999].

## Basic Ideas:
##       Facts: you can only climb one or two steps. But you can't climb back.
##
##           0     1     2
##          10    15    20
##
##          There are only two cases to reach n, either from n-1 or n-2
##                f(n) = min(f(n-1)+cost[n-1], f(n-2)+cost[n-2])
##     Attention: The target we want to reach is not the last element. But the element after last element
##
## Complexity: Time O(n), Space O(1)

    # Improvement: we don't need list to save the result.
    #              It will only involve two of previous result.
