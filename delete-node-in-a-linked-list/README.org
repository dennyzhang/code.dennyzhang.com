Delete Node in a Linked List
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Write a function to delete a node (except the tail) in a singly linked list, given only access to that node.

Supposed the linked list is 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 and you are given the third node with value 3, the linked list should become 1 -> 2 -> 4 after calling your function.

Leave me comments, if you know how to solve.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode(object):
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.next = None

class Solution(object):
    def deleteNode(self, node):
        """
        :type node: ListNode
        :rtype: void Do not return anything, modify node in-place instead.
        """
        ## Idea: update the value p.val with p.next.val, then remove p.next
        ## Complexity: Time O(n), Space O(1)
        ## Data Sample
        ##    1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5
        ##              node p 
        p = node.next # q will always exist
        node.val = p.val
        node.next = p.next
