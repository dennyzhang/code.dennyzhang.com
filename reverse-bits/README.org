Reverse bits of a given 32 bits unsigned integer.

For example, given input 43261596 (represented in binary as 00000010100101000001111010011100), return 964176192 (represented in binary as 00111001011110000010100101000000).

Follow up:
If this function is called many times, how would you optimize it?

Leave me comments, if you know how to solve.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
class Solution(object):
    def reverseBits(self, n):
        i = 0
        ret = 0
        while i < 32:
            ret = ret << 1
            ret = ret | (n % 2)
            n = n >> 1
            i = i + 1
        return ret
