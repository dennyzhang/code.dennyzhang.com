Leave me comments, if you know how to solve.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
class Solution(object):
## Basic Ideas: power of any prime number
##              3 is a prime
##              If 3 % k == 0 and k is a prime, then k is 3.
##              Thus 3^19 % n === 0 means n is power of 3
class Solution(object):
    def isPowerOfThree(self, n):
        """
        :type n: int
        :rtype: bool
        """
        if n <= 0:
            return False
        larget_power3 = pow(3, 19)
        return larget_power3 % n == 0
