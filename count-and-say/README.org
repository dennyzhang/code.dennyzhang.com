Count and Say
---------------------------------------------------------------------
The count-and-say sequence is the sequence of integers with the first five terms as following:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
1.     1
2.     11
3.     21
4.     1211
5.     111221
#+END_EXAMPLE

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
1 is read off as "one 1" or 11.
11 is read off as "two 1s" or 21.
21 is read off as "one 2, then one 1" or 1211.
#+END_EXAMPLE
Given an integer n, generate the nth term of the count-and-say sequence.

Note: Each term of the sequence of integers will be represented as a string.
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
Example 1:

Input: 1
Output: "1"
#+END_EXAMPLE

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
Example 2:

Input: 4
Output: "1211"
#+END_EXAMPLE
