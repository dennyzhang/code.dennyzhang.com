Given a non-empty string s and a dictionary wordDict containing a list of non-empty words, determine if s can be segmented into a space-separated sequence of one or more dictionary words. You may assume the dictionary does not contain duplicate words.  

For example, given  

    s = "leetcode",
    dict = ["leet", "code"].
    
    Return true because "leetcode" can be segmented as "leet code".
