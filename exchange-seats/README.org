Mary is a teacher in a middle school and she has a table seat storing students' names and their corresponding seat ids.

The column id is continuous increment.
Mary wants to change seats for the adjacent students.
Can you write a SQL query to output the result for Mary?
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
+---------+---------+
|    id   | student |
+---------+---------+
|    1    | Abbot   |
|    2    | Doris   |
|    3    | Emerson |
|    4    | Green   |
|    5    | Jeames  |
+---------+---------+
#+END_EXAMPLE

For the sample input, the output is:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
+---------+---------+
|    id   | student |
+---------+---------+
|    1    | Doris   |
|    2    | Abbot   |
|    3    | Green   |
|    4    | Emerson |
|    5    | Jeames  |
+---------+---------+
#+END_EXAMPLE

Note:
If the number of students is odd, there is no need to change the last one's seat.

select s1.id as id, s2.student as student
from seat as s1 join seat as s2
where (s1.id % 2 = 1 and s2.id = s1.id + 1) or (s1.id % 2 = 0 and s1.id = s2.id + 1)
or (s1.id %2 = 1 and s1.id = s2.id and s1.id in (select max(id) from seat))
