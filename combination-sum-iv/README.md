Given an integer array with all positive numbers and no duplicates, find the number of possible combinations that add up to a positive integer target.  

Example:  

    nums = [1, 2, 3]
    target = 4
    
    The possible combination ways are:
    (1, 1, 1, 1)
    (1, 1, 2)
    (1, 2, 1)
    (1, 3)
    (2, 1, 1)
    (2, 2)
    (3, 1)
    
    Note that different sequences are counted as different combinations.
    
    Therefore the output is 7.

Follow up:  
-   What if negative numbers are allowed in the given array?
-   How does it change the problem?
-   What limitation we need to add to the question to allow negative numbers?
